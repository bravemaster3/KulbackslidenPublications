- Make sure to be on the gh-pages branch of the repository, 
- In the "code" tab, navigate to the "data/KRI Publication list.csv" file
- Toggle editing,
- Down in the list, add the number of the publication (look at previous number) and the citation of the new publication, both separated by a comma.
- Please make sure to leave one blank line at the end of the file as it was before.
